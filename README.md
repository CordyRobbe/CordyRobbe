Hi! My name is Robbe Cordy,
Applied Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence student
This Github page will be a display of everything I've done so far and what I am currently working on.
If you have any question don't hesitate to ask me!

Thesis  - doing:
https://github.com/CordyRobbe/BAP
In this thesis is research the effects of style transfer on object detection capabilities of AI.
Comparing the result of normal object detection with the object detection on style transfered images.

LeetCode - doing:
https://leetcode.com/cordyrobbe/
Casually making exercises to slowly master Java as main coding language.

AI Internship - finished:
https://github.com/CordyRobbe/Stage-KMSKB
This internship was to try and help an art historian in detecting similar flowers in paintings. Because I wanted to use AI
I needed a of data. This is how I ended up using style transfer in images to create more "painting-like" images and detect on those
images to see if we could use AI.

AI In Comics - finished:
https://github.com/CordyRobbe/AI-in-comics-cartoons
Project in group where the idea was to implement AI in the coloring process of comics.
Tried different approaches such as GAN, we eventually decicded that a combination of classic coding and AI gave the best result.
